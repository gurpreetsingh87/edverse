# edverse
Edverse tokens

#1. We have created our own “EDV token” and for review purposes have set the initial supply as 10,000. This initial supply will be different at the time of launch.

#2.	The created token is “ERC20 type” and is extending the “OpenZeppelin standard”.

#3.	The contracts are written in Solidity.  After compiling the contacts will be published on the Meta-mask and blockchain.

#4.	The created contracts are available in the “Contracts” folder with 2 main contracts tiled – “EDVToken.sol” and “EDVVendor.sol”.
 - In the “EDVToken.sol” we are defining our token and the initial supply.
 - The “EDVVendor.sol”, although won’t be used for releasing our token but we have creating this if in future the buying and selling of the tokens is to be done via the web interface.
